<h3>Attack Vector: </h3>
  
 
The attack vector for this vulnerability involves an attacker exploiting the unsanitized user input in the 'formats' parameter to inject malicious template directives, which can lead to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) attacks. The attacker can upload a file and intercept the request to modify the 'formats' parameter value with a payload that includes a template directive that executes arbitrary code. In this case, the attacker is using the 'dqopi<%= File.open('/etc/passwd').read %>fdfdsf' payload to read the contents of the '/etc/passwd' file on the server. This can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potentially take control of the server.

<h3>CVE Impact Other: </h3>
SSTI vulnerabilities are serious and can lead to a complete compromise of the application's data and functionality, and often of the server that is hosting the application. Attackers may also use the server as a platform for further attacks against other systems.
